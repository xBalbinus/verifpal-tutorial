# Verifpal tutorial

This tutorial is adapted from a [getting started with Verifpal video by Symbolic Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4__KcGU2ALE). We will look at an example and a use case on Signal, a popular encrypted messaging service. The tutorial aims to introduce the basics of Verifpal and how it can be used to analyze cryptographic protocols. The example and signal folders have fully annotated code to get you started!
